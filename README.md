# Discord-Fake-Embed-Link

<h3>Update:</h3>
<p>Apparently the bug still works. I recreated this over at my website https://www.musicdude.tk/fake_embed, so you should use it from there now</p>
<br>

Creates a fake embed that shows up in Discord. It uses a glitch with spoilers to make one file look like it was from another URL.

Very easy to use

If your antivirus detects it as malware, you can inspect the source code yourself
